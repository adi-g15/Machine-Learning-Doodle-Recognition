# Machine Learning: Doodle Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

Step by step tutorial series on making a game like **Quick, Draw!**. It is an online game that challenges players to draw a doodle and then artificial intelligence guesses what the drawings represent.

To show the process of developing this game, here is the source code for the **Doodle Predictor** game made in HTML5 using [Phaser 2 framework](http://phaser.io/) and [TensorFlow.js library](https://js.tensorflow.org/) for machine learning. To recognize doodles, the game uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on the small subset of the [Quick Draw Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).

To get a quick insight into the project, watch the video trailer:

This project is divided into 8 parts. Each part includes a video and fully-commented source code so you can follow game development step by step.

Here is a game screenshot after completing the last part:

## Running the Game 

To play this game locally, you need to run it using a local web server as follows:
1. install, configure and run a web server: for instance, let's suppose your server is XAMPP installed in **C:\Xampp** 
2. navigate to the server document root: **C:\Xampp\htdocs**
3. create a new folder called 'doodle_predictor': **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**
4. download the project
5. copy all project files directly in **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**
6. now you should have the following folder structure under **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**:  
	**\assets** (with game resources)  
	**\data** (with datasets)  
	**\libs** (with libraries)  
	**\part1** (with source files of the part 1)  

7. open a web browser and navigate to the **http\://localhost:<port>/doodle_predictor/part1**  
  to run the game of the part 1


## Part 1: Introduction 

In this part, we just create a new Phaser Game object and build the basic game structure. 

Revision history:  

`main.js`
- created the Main Program with the main state
- defined all substates of the main state
- added the main loop where the entire game logic will be implemented


`ui.js`
- created a new User Interface class to allow users an interaction with the game
- created 'Play More Games' button with the corresponding trigger function
- created text object for showing messages in the status-bar
