# Machine Learning: Doodle Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

Step by step tutorial series on making a game like **Quick, Draw!**. It is an online game that challenges players to draw a doodle and then artificial intelligence guesses what the drawings represent.

This tutorial series shows the whole process of developing the same game called **Doodle Predictor** that runs directly in the browser.

To get a quick insight into the project, watch the video trailer:

## Tutorial Info

The game is made in HTML5 using [Phaser 2 framework](https://phaser.io/) and [TensorFlow.js library](https://js.tensorflow.org/) for machine learning. 

To classify drawings, we will implement an **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** based on **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

To avoid loading big data files, the model will be trained on a small subset of the [Quick Draw Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).

Here is a screenshot of the fully completed Doodle Predictor game:

## Tutorial Topics

This project is divided into the following 8 parts:

* Part 1: Project Setup  
* Part 2: Getting Data  
* Part 3: Building the Model  
* Part 4: Training the Model  
* Part 5: Predicting Samples  
* Part 6: Drawing Doodles  
* Part 7: Recognizing Doodles  
* Part 8: Adding More Doodle Categories  

Each part contains a video and a fully commented source code so you can easily follow the game development step by step.



## Running the Game

To play this game locally, you need to run it in a browser using a local web server as follows:

1. install, configure and run a web server: for instance, let's suppose your server is XAMPP installed in **C:\Xampp** 
2. navigate to the server document root: **C:\Xampp\htdocs**
3. create a new folder called 'doodle_predictor': **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**
4. download the project
5. copy all project files directly in **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**
6. now you should have the following folder structure under **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**:  
	**\assets** (with game resources)  
	**\data** (with datasets)  
	**\libs** (with libraries)  
	**\part1** (with source files of the part 1)  
	...  

7. open a web browser and navigate to the **http\://localhost:\<port\>/doodle_predictor/part1**  
  to run the game of the part 1


## Part 1: Project Setup 

In this part, we just create a new Phaser Game object and build the basic game structure. 

Updates:  

`main.js`
- created the Main Program with the main state
- defined all substates of the main state
- added the main loop where the entire game logic will be implemented


`ui.js`
- created a new User Interface class to allow users an interaction with the game
- created 'Play More Games' button with the corresponding trigger function
- created text object for showing messages in the status-bar

## Part 2: Getting Data

In this part, we load three datasets (car, fish and snowman) and split them into training and test data.

Updates:  

`main.js`
- added routines for opening and loading datasets

`ui.js`
- no changes

`cnn.js`
- created a new CNN class for implementing a Convolutional Neural Network model
- added function for splitting dataset into training and test data


## Part 3: Building the Model

In this part, we build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.

Updates:  

`main.js`
- minor changes

`ui.js`
- no changes

`cnn.js`
- added code for creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model


## Part 4: Training the Model

In this part, we train, test and evaluate the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Additionally, we plot graphs of the model's Loss and Accuracy during training.

Updates:  

`main.js`
- added logic for starting and executing the training in the main loop
- added actions that must be performed on clicking "Train More" button

`ui.js`
- created bitmaps for displaying loss and accuracy graphs
- created "Train More" button with the corresponding trigger function
- added function for plotting graphs

`cnn.js`
- defined CNN parameters
- added function for executing the training loop
- added function for fetching Training Batch
- added function for fetching Test Batch
