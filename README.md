# Machine Learning: Doodle Recognition with Convolutional Neural Network

Step by step tutorial series on making a game like **Quick, Draw!**. It is an online game that challenges players to draw a doodle and then artificial intelligence guesses what the drawings represent.

This tutorial series shows the whole process of developing the same game called **Doodle Predictor** that runs directly in the browser.

To get a quick insight into the project, watch the following videos:

[Episode #2: Parts 1-4](https://youtu.be/-iBBWDJrUEs)  
[Episode #3: Parts 5-8](https://youtu.be/rCogVEJe3s)  


## Tutorial Info

The game is made in HTML5 using [Phaser 2 framework](https://phaser.io/) and [TensorFlow.js library](https://js.tensorflow.org/) for machine learning. 

To classify drawings, we will implement an **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** based on **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

To avoid loading big data files, the model will be trained on a small subset of the [Quick Draw Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data).

Here is a screenshot of the fully completed Doodle Predictor game:

## Running the Game

To play this game locally, you need to run it in a browser using a local web server as follows:

1. install, configure and run a web server: for instance, let's suppose your server is XAMPP installed in **C:\Xampp** 
2. navigate to the server document root: **C:\Xampp\htdocs**
3. create a new folder called 'doodle_predictor': **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**
4. download the project
5. copy all project files directly in **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**
6. now you should have the following folder structure under **C:\Xampp\htdocs\doodle_predictor**:  
	**\assets** (with game resources)  
	**\data** (with datasets)  
	**\libs** (with libraries)  
	**\part1** (with source files of the part 1)  
	...  

7. open a web browser and navigate to the **http\://localhost:\<port\>/doodle_predictor/part1**  
  to run the game of the part 1


## Tutorial Topics

This project is divided into the following 8 parts:

* Part 1: Project Setup  
* Part 2: Getting Data  
* Part 3: Building the Model  
* Part 4: Training the Model  
* Part 5: Predicting Samples  
* Part 6: Drawing Doodles  
* Part 7: Recognizing Doodles  
* Part 8: Adding More Doodle Categories  

Each part contains a video and a fully commented source code so you can easily follow the game development step by step.



## Part 1: Project Setup 

Tasks: 
- creating the Main Program with the main state
- defining all substates of the main state
- building the basic game structure with the main loop where the entire game logic will be implemented
- creating a new User Interface class to allow users an interaction with the game
